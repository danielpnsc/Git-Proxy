# Wits-Proxy
##Tools for linux terminal to cope with annoying Wits proxy.
### setproxy.sh
Adds the wits proxy to your current environment.
NOTE: It sets the git proxy globally, which means it gets saved. If you are not using this on a personal pc, I'd recommend removing the proxy when done, using this script.

##Enable execution permissions first with:
```shell
# u is for user. You can use g:group o:others a:all
chmod u+x script.sh #Replace script.sh with the script.
```
##Running setproxy.sh
####NOTE! Run setproxy.sh with:
```shell
  source setproxy.sh
```
Select 1 or 2.
Use your student number and CNS password.

####wgetproxy.sh can be ran in the normal way
```shell
./wgetproxy.sh
```
